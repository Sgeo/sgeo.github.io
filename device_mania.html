<span class="gmText"><span class="player0">GM Sgeo:</span> How many PP does each person start with? </span><br/>
<span class="player1">Jazz-R-RRR-1:</span> PP are treats that the GM gives out to entertaining players. By spending it, players can affect dice rolls - their own or other players.<br/>
<span class="player1">Jazz-R-RRR-1:</span> Typically, a player gets 20 PP.<br/>
<span class="player3">Costik-R-ANN-1:</span> So yes, it involves dice.<br/>
<span class="player1">Jazz-R-RRR-1:</span> In a way.<br/>
<span class="gmText"><span class="player0">GM Sgeo:</span> (I guess that means I should use dice?)</span><br/>
<span class="gmText"><span class="player0">GM Sgeo:</span> Not sure how well that will work</span><br/>

<span class="player2">* Farg-R-MAN-1 "...kay" Frag wispers back *</span><br/>
<span class="player1">Jazz-R-RRR-1</span> says, "Perhaps we'll get to field-test exciting new equipment, like Teela-O! Won't that be great?"<br/>
<span class="player23">The tech person:</span> I will give you back the PDCs. Due to the nature of the mission, you will be allowed to use "d-on" devices in sector DON<br/>
<span class="player1">Jazz-R-RRR-1 . o O ( Guys, there's PM windows you can use. )</span><br/>
<span class="player3">Costik-R-ANN-1</span> says, "D-on devices?"<br/>
